# 🐦 Flappy Bird Game (PFUND Project)

This is a Flappy Bird game developed as part of the **PFUND (Programming Fundamentals)** semester project.  
The game is created using **Python** and **Pygame** library, along with **Random, OS, and Sys** modules.  
The project focuses on basic game development concepts including object movement, collision detection, and game loops.

## 🎮 Game Preview

The player controls a bird that must fly through randomly positioned pipes without touching them.  
Each pipe passed successfully increases the score.
